## Registration Form (React)

This is a **beginner-friendly React project** that shows a complete, working **registration form** with validation.

### How to run it on your computer (Windows)

1. **Open a terminal** in this folder:  
   `C:\Users\THIERRY\Desktop\Registration form using React`
2. Make sure you have **Node.js** installed (version 18+ is recommended).  
   If you don't have it, download it from the official Node.js website.
3. In the terminal, install the dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

5. The terminal will show a **local URL**, usually something like:

   ```text
   http://localhost:5173/
   ```

   Open that URL in your **browser** (Chrome, Edge, etc.) to see the registration form.
